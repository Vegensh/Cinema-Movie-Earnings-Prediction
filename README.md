Machine learning project predicting movie earnings using extensive movie metadata like budget, cast, director, awards, and IMDb score. Implements a Decision Tree Regressor and offers a Streamlit web app for real-time earnings prediction based on user inputs.
# Cinema Movie Earnings Prediction

## Project Description
This project uses machine learning to predict a movie's box office earnings based on metadata such as budget, cast, director's past performance, awards, release year, genre, and IMDb score. The model employs a Decision Tree Regressor and is deployed with a Streamlit web app for easy real-time prediction.

## Features
- Data preprocessing with missing value handling and outlier detection
- Encoding categorical features like actors, genre, and director
- Decision Tree Regression for earnings prediction
- Interactive Streamlit UI for user input and instant prediction

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of over 3,900 movies with 16+ features, including budget, box office statistics, awards, and IMDb scores.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
2. Enter the movie features in the web interface
3. View the predicted earnings instantly

## Model Evaluation
- Achieved high accuracy with RÂ² score above 0.98
- Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error are minimized for reliable predictions

## Future Work
- Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting
- Add poster image analysis or sentiment analysis of reviews
- Expand dataset with newer movie entries and features
